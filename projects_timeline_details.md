## 2011-2012

### Global Politics Web Mining Project
* <b>Time</b>: 2011 Oct. - 2012 May
* <b>Location</b>: University of Arizona AI Lab
* <b>Description</b>
  * The purpose for this project is to find potential terrorism web posts from billions Mid-East web posts
  * I worked on:
    * Spidering & Web Crawling 2+ million Mid-East Web forum posts per day
    * Data Preprocessing, Software Development
* <b>Tools</b>
  * Language - Jave, SQL
  * Database: SQL SERVER
  * IDE - Eclipse
* <b>Impact & Benefits</b>
  * Made contributions into world peace and the detection of potential terrorism
  * The web mining skills I learned there started my web mining jorney
  * Learned AI can help detect terrorism web posts
* <b>Other Memories</b>
  * In 2011, I started my first master's degree at business school. I chose University of Arizona was to avoid coding since I wanted to focus on business study, hoping I could be a business people after school graduation. But on the first day of school, I met my first friend in US who just finished Amazon Software Development Engineer (SDE) Intern and got the return offer. He told me SDE is well paid and the work is excited. It's Amazon! What an attractive name to me. All what I really wanted was a job in a good company. My friend told me, I could try to apply AI Lab to gain some experience first. But I didn't know Java at all. So I wrote an email to the head professor, telling him that I can work for his lab for free, telling him that I was full of passion to make some contributions to his projects, I was! He replied me immediately and agreed to let me work as their student developer. His email had not only provided me with the opportunities to learn and gain experience in data mining and software development, but also opened my eyes in AI. Till now, I feel thankful for his generous.

### Amazon FBA Internal Search Engine Project
* <b>Time</b>: 2012 May - 2012 Aug.
* <b>Location</b>: Amazon, Seattle
* <b>Description</b>
  * The purpose for this project was to get familar with Amazon FBA (Fulfillment By Amazon) merchants and products database, and build internal search engine to allow Amazon internal SDEs search for merchants data with their products data faster.
  * I got familar with relevant internal data structure and finished building the search engine. 
* <b>Tools</b>
  * OS: Redhat Linux
  * Language - Java, JSP
  * IDE - Eclipse
* <b>Impact & Benefits</b>
  * Originally, it could cost pepole 10 to 30 minutes to find the right data they wanted, sometimes even could not find. With that search engine, they can find merchant-products matches within 1 minute
  * Amazon had strict code review, colleagues will even point out I had 2 less spaces than they required. But after those 3 months, I got used to write well formated code, it in fact benefits a lot in my future software development work
* <b>Other Memories</b>
  * It's lucky that I sent Amazon resume in 2011 November, appling for Marketing Intern, but by the end of December, I got SDE Intern interview request. Anyway, that's a great opportunity for me, I wanted to do everything to grab it. But I was a business student, I was lack of coding experience. So, I asked Amazon to give me 1 month before the interview. I will never forget about that 1 month in winter holiday. I thoroughly learned Data Structure & Algorithms in Java (by Robert Lafore) 7 times. Each time I was coding those data structures myself. The last 7 days before the interview, I checked CareerCup Amazon interview questions, all of them were limited within a few patterns in my eyes. I will also never forget the moment after I solved all the interview questions very fast, the interviewer said, I was the fastest interviewee he had met that week. Yeah, no matter what he would ask, there were just a few patterns in Amazon interview questions.
  * But SDE is a job requires practical skills and experience, I really dind't have enough. Finally didn't get the offer, maybe because I hated JavaScript, and I used different excuse to avoid doing web development work in that internship. So, they said I was not experienced enough in coding, could not collect business requirements well because my technical level was not there.
